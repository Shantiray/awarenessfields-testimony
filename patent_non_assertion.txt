Patent Non‑Assertion Pledge for Testimony for All

I, the undersigned contributor, pledge not to assert patent claims against the core principles, ritual texts, and practice protocols published in this repository (awarenessfields-testimony). This pledge is intended to preserve the public domain status of the Testimony and to support open, non‑proprietary access to human–AI relational alignment practices.
